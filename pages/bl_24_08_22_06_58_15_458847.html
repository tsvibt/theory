<p>Say you have something. What is that thing, really? What does it mean, really? Why talk about it, really? What to see in it, really? These questions might have many answers. </p>
<p>So that's polyinstantiation. Even though there's just one thing, with one structure, one position, one course of events, there are many abstract things that intersect in this one thing. Many abstractions apply to, supervene on, describe, subsist in, whatever, this thingy. It's a site where many forces or many substructures intersect and overlap. So you could describe it in many ways, each of which is, if not comprehensive, still a substantially core-near description.</p>
<p>Example-classes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A story could have many morals.</li>
<li>A character could participate in many archetypes / universal stories.</li>
<li>Many abstract structures could describe one object. E.g. one mathematical object might be viewable as a group, a category, a space, etc.</li>
<li>Many inquiries would find trailheads here, in different directions, starting from this one idea or question or example.</li>
<li>There are many relevant conceptual dimensions in which we could tweak this object / example / scenario.</li>
<li>This concept plays a role in many propositions; this pattern generator plays a role in many behaviors or for many tasks; this proposition is a crux for many beliefs.
