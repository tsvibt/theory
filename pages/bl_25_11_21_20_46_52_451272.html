Really, <a href="https://tsvibt.github.io/theory/pages/bl_25_11_10_01_11_48_420005.html">God has unboundedly growing dimensionality</a>, in the same way and for the same reason that individual humans--in their full unbounded flowering--have unboundedly growing dimensionality.</p>
<p>Since God is very high-dimensional, <a href="https://tsvibt.github.io/theory/pages/bl_25_11_12_01_25_36_704819.html">theogenesis</a> is a high-dimensional vector. God is being created/manifested progressively along many dimensions; this process goes ahead at different speeds on different dimensions; this process is driven by many different people, in different times and places, to different extents for different dimensions. For example, the might be court systems here, but not there. There might be a society that is internally high-trust, but aggressively warlike towards its neighbors. Someone might be honest and kind, but not participating in many-person coordination efforts that have to be reasoned explicitly; or vice versa.</p>
<p>The theogenic spectrum has a few implications:</p>
<ul>
<li>There's no simple notion of &quot;more/less Godly&quot;. It's like asking which object is &quot;better&quot;--sometimes there's a fairly clear answer, but usually it's at least a bit context-dependent, and often very context dependent.</li>
<li>Thinking in terms of Godliness as a single attribute is usually too blunt force. It makes sense to say &quot;a judge taking a bribe is very unGodly&quot;, but it doesn't make much sense to say &quot;you should be more Godly&quot;--usually you should say what you mean.</li>
<li>The theogenic spectrum is one way to be reminded of the enormity of God. An implication of that is to not be too impatient for theogenesis, and also to not be negligent in contributing to theogenesis. &quot;<a href="https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.2.16?lang=bi&amp;with=all&amp;lang2=en">It is not your duty to finish the work, but neither are you at liberty to neglect it.</a>&quot;</li>
<li>Combining the above points, it mostly doesn't make much sense to think in terms of generally working to advance theogenesis. Mostly one thinks of being more kind, creating more peace, figuring out out to think more indepedently, learn to be more truthful, understanding group agency, figuring out <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/zLG2DnJw6oEZqAgaE/tools-for-deferring-gracefully">how to defer more gracefully</a>, <a href="https://tsvibt.github.io/theory/pages/bl_25_11_16_08_16_18_894528.html">setting up courts</a>, and so on.</li>
</ul>
