<p>Reason 1: God is <a href="https://tsvibt.github.io/theory/pages/bl_25_11_10_01_37_41_628279.html">not yet omnipotent</a>. So there can be suffering and injustice. There can even be suffering and injustice which is needless, meaningless, unhealed, and never redeemed for some greater good.</p>
<p>Reason 2: Some suffering is intrinsic. As a simple example, doing real Science or Art might require some degree of struggle, including suffering. It may be that this suffering can be always needful, meaningful, healed, and redeemed for some greater good. A murkier kind of example is suffering that is more intrinsic to humane growth, to theogenesis [TODO link]. This suffering is also redeemed, and cannot be avoided. For example, <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/w/ontological-crisis">ontological crises</a> may intrinsically require giving up / destroying some of your old ways of being / ways of hoping, which might intrinsically involve suffering.</p>
