<p>Particles never move except in exact accordance with physical law. If there are miracles, prayers, divine speech, etc., they are meso-scale phenomena that also proceed from simple non-mental physical material operating under simple non-mental physical dynamical laws. We are, at least for now [TODO link omnipotence], <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/sYgv4eYH82JEsTD34/beyond-the-reach-of-god">Beyond the Reach of God</a>.</p>
<p>You will never see a particle move differently due to the reality of God. However, you may see assemblages of particles move differently due to the reality of God. This makes sense in the same way that free will is not only compatible with physical determinism, but actually <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NEeW7eSXThPz7o4Ne/thou-art-physics">requires physical determinism</a>. Particles move differently because of the reality of 2+3=5; and because of the reality of the U.S. government; and because of God. If you want to say it like that.</p>
<p>So then, am I saying that <a href="https://tsvibt.github.io/theory/pages/bl_25_11_10_01_30_10_763079.html">God is basically just a cognitive phenomenon manifested in patterns of neurons firing</a>?</p>
