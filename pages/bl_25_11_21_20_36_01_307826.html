But again, don't worry, you can do as you please--<a href="https://tsvibt.github.io/theory/pages/bl_25_11_16_08_25_19_987466.html">as long as you're acting rightly</a>. You might be able to ask a rabbi for moral advice even if you aren't Jewish or a practicing Jew. But that would only be better for understanding how religion and God are supposed to work; for how to live, and how find your community, I couldn't give advice.</p>
<p>I don't practice any religion. I don't even keep Shabbat, which is the first of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Commandments#Commandments_text_and_numbering">Ten Commandments</a> that isn't about God specifically. I think that <a href="https://tsvibt.github.io/theory/pages/bl_25_11_16_08_16_18_894528.html">God would judge</a> me to have been ok. I don't actually trust that this commandment is correct for the situation I find myself in. I'm not sure.</p>
