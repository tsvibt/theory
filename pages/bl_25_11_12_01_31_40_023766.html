Authority can flow from God, but we start as individuals <a href="https://tsvibt.github.io/theory/pages/bl_25_11_12_01_25_36_704819.html">creating God</a>, choosing God, and giving ourselves to God. We only partially give ourselves to God and God's service; we want to have our own separate individual perspectives and experiences.</p>
<p>It's possible for God to give us commands that we should follow even if we don't understand why. But that's only by us constructing that God.</p>
<p>There is a tension here, but it's not incidental, it's a creative tension that's part of the real relationship between real humans and God. See &quot;<a href="https://tsvibt.blogspot.com/2025/11/love-after-singularity.html#:~:text=Condivergence">Condivergence</a>&quot;.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_wrestling_with_the_angel">Ya'akov wrestled with a man or an angel</a> and thereby got the name &quot;Yeesra'el&quot; (&quot;Israel&quot;), which is taken to mean &quot;struggles with El (God)&quot;. That's the right relationship between human and God. God is not our Lord, although God is the ruler of the cosmos.</p>
