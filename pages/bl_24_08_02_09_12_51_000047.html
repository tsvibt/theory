<p>Planting a question is when you start trying to answer a question, enough that the question gets its hooks into your mind, and then you stop deliberately paying attention to the question. </p>
<p>Planting questions is a <a href="https://tsvibt.github.io/theory/pages/bl_24_07_27_16_11_32_875751.html">forgotten fundamental of thinking about hard problems</a>.</p>
<p>Just asking the question often isn't enough. Trying to answer the question is more likely to plant the question, but also often isn't enough. Some activities that might help plant a question:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vary the question--e.g. try to ask an analogous question in a different domain, or ask an analogus question but about a different aspect. </li>
<li>Is there some stuff that would probably answer or half-answer the question, if you knew it? Is there some other stuff that probably wouldn't?</li>
<li>Can you shortcut or circumvent the question? If not, what's the core of why the question stubbornly asks itself?</li>
</ul>
<p>See <a href="https://tsvibt.blogspot.com/2023/09/a-hermeneutic-net-for-agency.html#the-basic-idea-brute-force-global-analysis">here</a> for more.</p>

<p>A planted question sometimes grows. That means:</p>
<ul>
<li>It asks subquestions. You wonder about things related to the question.</li>
<li>It recognizes things. You bump into something that informs the question.</li>
<li>It makes allies. You bump into something that seems analogous--so now the question applies to and is informed by both analogands.</li>
<li>It bears fruit--maybe--eventually. </li>
</ul>

<li>I like to avoid spoilers. When I go rock climbing, I don't want to know a correct or workable method for climbing a route--I want to figure out what does and doesn't work. If I glance at someone climb part of a route that I haven't already tride, it's fine: a glimpse of their movement or body position doesn't mean much to me, it doesn't spoil the puzzle. However, if I've already struggled with the route and gotten stuck, the even a glimpse might click something into place or collapse a bunch of uncertainty. Just a glimpse. The planted question is volatile, it increases recognition surface area, it sets up landing pads for helicopters of knowledge lol.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Richard Feynman was fond of giving the following advice on how to be a genius. You have to keep a dozen of your favorite problems constantly present in your mind, although by and large they will lay in a dormant state. Every time you hear or read a new trick or a new result, test it against each of your twelve problems to see whether it helps. Every once in a while there will be a hit, and people will say: "How did he do it? He must be a genius!"</p>

<p>Let's demarcate planting and dwelling https://tsvibt.github.io/theory/pages/bl_24_07_27_07_43_17_504420.html</p>
<h3 id="planting-without-dwelling">Planting without dwelling</h3>
<ul>
<li>Planting a narrow or technical question, e.g. one with an <a href="https://tsvibt.github.io/theory/pages/bl_24_07_25_09_52_56_652909.html">algebraic</a> character. Think of the tetris effect, or thinking about a programming problem. Something is planted, but it's fairly narrow. It's crunchy, but not necessarily deep. Such a question probably wasn't dwelled-in (though it could be). </li>
<li>Combining two planted questions.</li>
<li>Planting a question in a piecemeal way. E.g. being exogenously exposed to something over and over, and asking many little questions about it, and combining those questions, building up around more central questions bit by bit, with the more central questions gaining primacy and momentum, without ever being dwelled on.  (Though possibly it would be better to think of this as coming from some sort of "piecemeal dwelling"?)</li>
</ul>
<p>wellidng withouat planting:
questions might be resolved
questions might not take root--too dififuclt, too alien
there may not have been really much questeion--eg. a simple skill can be dwelled in. (usually there's a possiblitiy for planting questions)</p>
<p>leaving a porblem half finishied to get shaower thoughts</p>
<p>the question stays there and grows; you might return to the question, eg to help it grow there, or because some nwe thing you've seen means you whatever, or because it's time to harvest (apply what you've learned from investigating the question, to some other problem)</p>
<p>dwelling in is a ... planting. dwelling-in help to plant the question; and a well-platnde questions draws you to dwell
you dwell because you know that place--it's arranged nicesly , you know how to live there; and you know how to live there because you have dweled there</p>

<p>will be dwelling-in and returning-to the question.</p>
<p>try to solve the whole problem from scratch. start having reference frame.</p>
<p>is this doomed?</p>

<h1 id="sharpening">Sharpening</h1>
<p>should think about strategy and the whole alignment problem until the question is planted; and that is the main benefit (that is the progress toward the promise of future fruit, not the present fruit).</p>
<p>as a blunt allocation: more time to the basic questions--okea. 
a bit more precisely: not just that you should do it, but also how. &lt;-- another article</p>

<h1 id="ways-that-people-dont-do-it">ways that people don't do it</h1>
<p>deference
avoiding it because it's too hard, no traction, would take too long, no immediate benefit
pretending to do it
if it feels boring or pointless, there's a very high chance that <em>something</em> is wrong, and a pretty high chance that you should do it in a different way or do something else entierely. </p>

<p>Nucleation. Like planting a seed or nucleating a crystal, a word creates a site that begins to play a role and begins to collect material that helps to play that role.</p>
<p>Tentpoles. By preliminarily setting up a site that begins to play a role in thinking, a word helps set up a context where other ideas can more fully be called to play their own role. By raising one tentpole, the other tentpoles take on more meaning: together they lift the tent fabric to create more space.</p>
