<p>That is, God is the {mind, soul, agency} of humanity, collectively, insofar as we have a collective / communal {mind, soul, agency}. Or rather, of <em>future</em> humanity. In other words, God is the shared transpersonal consciousness that we will construct and participate in, as we grow smarter, wiser, kinder, and more intertwined with one another. In this regard, of being the result or in the direction of some process of reflection, God is like <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/w/coherent-extrapolated-volition">Coherent Extrapolated Volition</a>.</p>
<p>God can be taken to have two aspects: noumenal and phenomenal. Noumenal is like the &quot;inside&quot; of God's mind, analogous to a human's internal experience; this is the computations, carried out in a way that's distributed across many humans, that constitute a kind of integrated perspective / mind / agency / valuing. Phenomenal is how individual humans or small groups of humans can interface with God--perceive, imagine, hear from, talk to, petition, take orders from, defer to, etc.</p>
<p>Individual humans participate in the noumenal God, but in a necessarily not-fully-understood way. This is because of the essentially <a href="https://tsvibt.github.io/theory/pages/bl_25_11_10_01_11_48_420005.html">not-fully-comprehensible nature of God</a>.</p>
