<p>For example: To ask whether there is <a href="https://tsvibt.github.io/theory/pages/bl_25_11_12_01_33_54_942092.html">one God or many</a> is partly a descriptive question, but also partly an exhortatory or moral or decision question. To believe &quot;there are many Gods&quot; might naturally imply &quot;I will not incline towards theogenic intercourse with the neighboring tribe&quot;. That's a decision, so values bear on it. We are <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/CuSTqHgeK4CMpWYTe/created-already-in-motion">created in motion</a>, with {values, stances, actions, plans, beliefs, propositions} never yet having been separated out from each other. When we say &quot;there are many Gods&quot;, by default this is a proposition, a stance-taking, a decision-making, a values-affirmation, and a goal-adoption, all in one. It may be a correct (or self-fulfilling) proposition, but an incorrect goal-adoption, or vice versa, etc.</p>
<p>So when we're asking whether to believe in God or not, or what are the attributes of the God we're supposed to believe in, often we're sort of asking &quot;What should we do?&quot;. (Or, &quot;What collectivity should we be, together?&quot;, or &quot;How should we think well together?&quot;.)</p>
