<p>An <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/tZKA7Qek2Pv92KMPS/donald-hobson-s-shortform?commentId=sx5HHgrRWvoim3Fd4">optimization channel</a> is some sort of pathway through which optimization flows. E.g. arms and legs; speech; <a href="https://tsvibt.blogspot.com/2023/09/sum-threshold-attacks.html">sum-threshold attacks</a>; doing math and then doing weirdly complexly structured behavior, such as programming a computer in some previously incomprehensible way that does something powerful; self-modification / self-improvement; acausal bargaining.</p>
<p>Channel-general goal pursuit is goal pursuit that is geared up to exert optimization power through any optimization channel.</p>
<p>Really this is two properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://tsvibt.blogspot.com/2023/06/telopheme-telophore-and-telotect.html">telophore</a> is structured so that it can potentially "hook itself up" to novelty (new understanding); it can learn the ropes in any domain / any idiom / any abstraction.</li>
<li>The mind has the capacity to be unboundedly creative--there's no understanding that's outside the mind's long-term trajectory of novelty.</li>
</ul>
<p>A mind could be unboundedly creative without pursuing a goal in a channel-general way. </p>
<p>There's some question here about whether to call non-channel-general goal pursuit "goal pursuit"; but we know for sure that such pursuit is important and approximately real, because that's most of what we see (though the situation is complicated).</p>
