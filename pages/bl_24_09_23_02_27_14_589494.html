          <p>The linked essay is a meditation. It starts with a simple idea and then turns that idea around in imagination, over and over, with intent gaze. It's not a presentation of a technical idea or argument. It may not have a point or moral. It may not say anything original. It may not be diligently fact-checked for the purpose of producing reliable conclusions (though it's probably checked enough to be in substantial commune with reality). </p>
