<p>No. Humans create, manifest, and participate in God. But God isn't just those computations, God is the structure that they participate in, and God is real independent of those computations actually happening anywhere.</p>
<p>One aspect of God is Justice. The ideal of Justice is a somewhat canonical, abstract ideal. It's discoverable, like the principles of Science are discoverable. Agents in different times and places could independently realize the reality of Justice, and decide to participate in it and manifest it.</p>
<p>However, God is in fact halfway in the mundane world, and <a href="https://tsvibt.github.io/theory/pages/bl_25_11_10_01_37_41_628279.html">is not yet omnipotent</a>, and therefore can be distorted [TODO link] and killed [TODO link]. In this sense, God <a href="https://tsvibt.github.io/theory/pages/bl_25_11_10_01_32_25_551111.html">is more rooted and intertwined with real humans than math is</a>. However, in some ways we should treat God as though God is universal and necessary and not dependent on specific human apprehensions of God [TODO link--rule of law not man; some contingencies, but they are deeper, eg our way of relating in general].</p>
