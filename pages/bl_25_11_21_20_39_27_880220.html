<p>Many atheists act rightly, which is <a href="https://tsvibt.github.io/theory/pages/bl_25_11_16_08_25_19_987466.html">more Godly than right belief</a>. In fact, many atheists are more connected with God than many theists. Many theists spread their &quot;faith&quot; by the sword, which is demonic. Many theists worship their &quot;god/s&quot; or &quot;prophets&quot; like idols. They fail to participate in theogenesis, or they corrupt theogenesis. Many atheists study and understand new aspects of God (epistemology, etc.).</p>
<p>However, the Theotic Breath is most easily breathed with groups of people who are open to theogenesis. A healthy community has young children and elders; the wise and the hardworking; the custodians, the matchmakers, the teachers, the thinkers. Insofar as atheists or theists have less of such a community, they are choked from the Theotic Breath.</p>
