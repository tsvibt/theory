<p>Religion is a subset of culture. It's the subset that relates to Godliness.</p>
<p>A particular style of food or dress would be part of culture, but generally not part of religion--though some food and some dress can be part of religious rituals.</p>
<p>The matter is confused for several reasons.</p>
<ul>
<li>For one thing, many religions are associated with a Nation (that is, a People). A Nation while have a comprehensive culture, which includes religious and non-religious elements. Further, religion and Godliness have some relationship to Nationhood. For example, Nationhood is helpful for <a href="https://tsvibt.github.io/theory/pages/bl_25_11_12_01_25_36_704819.html">theogenesis</a>, because many elements of God are elements you are supposed to work out as a large community.</li>
<li>For another, there's no sharp boundary.
<ul>
<li>Many elements of culture are not themselves especially Godly or unGodly, but might be generated by theogenic elements. For example, playing a team sport is not especially (un)Godly, but it can be a kind of exercise in theogenesis.</li>
<li>For example, in Judaism there is a distinction between law about human's relationship with God and law about human-human relationships. But law about human-human relationships is not strictly non-religious. For example, setting up a court system is human-human law (I think?), but it is an essential part of theogenesis relating to <a href="https://tsvibt.github.io/theory/pages/bl_25_11_16_08_16_18_894528.html">the Justice aspect of God</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
