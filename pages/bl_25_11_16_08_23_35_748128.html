That mental motion is called &quot;prayer&quot;. I'm not super familiar with it, but I have a little bit of experience with it, so I think I know enough to see that it's a thing and I'll say a bit about it.</p>
<p>In general, prayer is a kind of exhortatory mode of thinking. That is, you're exhorting (egging on, urging, pleading, pushing, compelling, exciting, energizing, pronouncing)--though it's not necessarily clear who you're exhorting, or what you're exhorting zer to do. It's a combination of wishing that something would be so; demanding of the world that it be this way; hoping that it be so; affirming, <em>precariously</em> (which is cognate with &quot;prayer&quot; and German &quot;fragen&quot; [to ask]), that it will be so... And if you'd permit the language, affirming that this is God's will; asking God how to make it so; asking God to make it so.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>While there were Israeli hostages held in Gaza, <a href="https://zemirotdatabase.org/view_song.php?id=19">Akheynu</a> was impactful to hear sung. I screamed it from the hilltops. Who would hear it, except my friend and myself? Maybe another hiker would hear. Maybe the sky would hear? What do I mean? That doesn't mean anything, but it does. It means I have to scream at the sky. Some of your thoughts have to be written out for you to think them. That's how you think them. Is this a cheer, like for a sports team? But it's not collective effervescence, it's effervescence of one or two. And what does that even mean. It's a cry. &quot;Sorrow&quot; is cognate with German &quot;Sorge&quot; meaning [care, concern]. You cry into your pillow alone. It's not a proposition, it's a process, an exertion, a reprogramming. May it be that they're returned home to safety, delivered, redeemed from captivity. Quickly now. Is it a comic waste of energy? It's not like my brainwaves are transmitted through the sky halfway around the world. But how else are we not a circular firing squad?</li>
<li>In writing the <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/34mDRmAbfkaMfoAcR/a-prayer-for-engaging-in-conflict">prayer for engaging in conflict</a>, I felt a realignment. Not that I suddenly knew what to do in any specific situation, or even that I as immediately more prepared. Rather, I felt as though I'd written a signpost and stuck it in the ground, probably roughly in the right direction; and now all I have to do is follow it, to get to being more prepared to handle conflict. To follow it, I just have to recite it and meditate on it.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/w/litany-of-tarski">Litany of Tarski</a> and the <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/w/litany-of-gendlin">Litany of Gendlin</a> have been influential in my thinking, since I read them as a teenager. It's not like I didn't know them in some sense--you can tell because, like many others, I immediately recognized them as good and true--but in another sense I did not know them. What I came to know was a prayer--an exhortation to myself.</li>
<li>I pray for the world to not end--<a href="https://tsvibt.blogspot.com/2025/04/a-suggestion-regarding-end-of-world.html">the sand, the sea, the rshrsh, the flash, the prayer</a>. I'm investing my hope. I'm not investing my hope in being magically saved by an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deus_ex_machina"><em>apo mekhanes theos</em></a>. But investing my hope is a process, a task, a muscle to exercise. It's something that deconcentrates, and that warrants reconcentration. I do pray that the sand is not melted into sludge, that the seas and the waters do not boil off, that the prayer of man isn't choked. Which is to say, I do want that, and the wanting steps out more as I sing the words.</li>
<li>I pray for peace. I scream <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esVRX1L5GFg">Heyveynu Shalom Aleykhem</a> (<a href="https://www.hebrewsongs.com/?songID=437">words</a>), and I dance to Loh Yeesah Goy (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXVvZ76F8R8">1</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lKai_9UNgQ">2</a>, <a href="https://www.zemirotdatabase.org/view_song.php?id=762">words</a>). It's sad and joyful; it's a hope for peace and a warning to myself to not act against peace.</li>
</ul>
