          <p>The linked concept, idea, argument, etc., is especially <a href="https://tsvibt.blogspot.com/2023/03/provisionality.html">provisional</a>. That means it's not worked out and may not be very much of a <a href="https://tsvibt.blogspot.com/2022/08/the-thingness-of-things.html">Thing</a>, or is mushing together different things inappropriately. It might be easily critiquable, or something I wouldn't really stand behind. It probably still has <em>something</em> of valuable, but might be especially likely to require more reworking, up front, before getting any value from it.</p>
