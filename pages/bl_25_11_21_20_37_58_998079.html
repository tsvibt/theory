<p>.שְׁמַע יִשְׂרָאֵל ה' אֱלֹהֵינוּ יְהוָה אֶחָד</p>
<p>It means:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hear, those who struggle with El, [the name] our Eloahs [the name] is one.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This strings the bow of <a href="https://tsvibt.github.io/theory/pages/bl_25_11_12_01_25_36_704819.html">theogenesis</a>, as it were. The tension is set, and will never be fully resolved. We struggle with El(oah), and this makes us suspect that we could make multiple Eloahs, or choose between multiple equally possible Eloahs, but this is not true, there is one true answer as much as there is one correct understanding of what is Good (and (modulo the conceptual-perspectivality) as much as there is one correct epistemology, probability theory, decision theory, moral theory).</p>
<p>The Shema continues (see <a href="https://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0506.htm#4">https://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0506.htm#4</a> for the Hebrew):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Love [the name] your Eloah with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might. And these words, which I command you this day, will be upon your heart. And teach them diligently to your children, and talk of them when you sit in your house and when you walk on the way, and when you lie down and when you rise up. And bind them as a sign on your arm, and they will be head-ornaments between your eyes. And write them on the doorposts of your house, and on your gates.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, that's a straightforward, self-explanatory, nutshell way to create a robust memetic self-propagator. Also quite pacific as far these things go.</p>
