Whether or not you go around saying &quot;God&quot; is among the least of God's concerns. What matters is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Look at your life through heaven's eyes. When you and your friends and the rest of humanity have grown up for a thousand years, what will they think of what you are doing today? They will be incomprehensibly empathetic--but they will still judge you. How will they judge you? You cannot know. But you can know some aspects of this. Are you choosing life and repairing the world?</li>
<li>Do the right actions. If you know the right actions but don't feel the right feelings about them, you still fulfill your obligations by doing the right actions; if you have the right feelings but do not do the right actions, you do not fulfill your obligations. <a href="https://www.jewishboston.com/read/i-often-hear-that-judaism-places-a-strong-emphasis-on-our-deeds-and-less-so-on-our-beliefs-what-does-this-mean-and-is-it-a-generalization/">&quot;That’s 99 more dollars to feed the hungry, clothe the naked and impact the world in ways faith and feelings, no matter how well-intentioned, never can or will.&quot;</a></li>
<li>Learn to seek the truth. Learn to investigate when you can and defer gracefully when you cannot.</li>
</ul>
<p>The True God and the followers of the True God won't beat you into submission. It won't be a problem, or if it's a problem, that's because theogenesis went wrong.</p>
