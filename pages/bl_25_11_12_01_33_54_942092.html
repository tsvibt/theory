<p>It's confusing because when we ask the question, the proper question we ask is: Is there one [thing that humans call &quot;Good&quot;] or many? <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/RBszS2jwGM4oghXW4/the-bedrock-of-morality-arbitrary">The bedrock of morality</a> is in us, so it points uniquely--but it points uniquely to something that would be different for aliens.</p>
<p>So aliens might have God-like coordination mechanisms, and group epistemology, and group values, and so on. But most aliens don't have a humane God, and when we say God we mean a humane God. So that's not another God of the same kind as our God. This is in the same way that the alien's notion of Good is not an equally valid (that is, equally [valid according to humans]) notion of Good, that we have to ourselves be uncertain about.</p>
<p>But, shouldn't the various Gods (the human-God, the Vulcan-God, the Corvid-God, etc.) all form a community, and merge into one big God? No.[TODO link below on merging]</p>
<p>That said, it's conceivable that there's enough path-dependence between different people that <a href="https://tsvibt.github.io/theory/pages/bl_25_11_12_01_25_36_704819.html">theogenesis</a> could truly diverge into multiple distinct stable [partial fixed states invariant along dynamic trajectories]. This would be confusing.</p>
