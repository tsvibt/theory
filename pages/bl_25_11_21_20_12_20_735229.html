They will do this by figuring out a decision procedure that is, so to speak, <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/abYDvsqmJkchzSY8q/meta-agentic-prisoner-s-dilemmas">the intersection of all their decision procedures</a>. From behind the veil of ignorance of &quot;Which specific God am I?&quot; this decision procedure makes a universally agreeable set of choices for all the Gods. Or something like that. This universal decision procedure is the one True God.</p>
<p>This is totally wrong. Yes, we and our God do negotiate with other superintelligences. But those are not Gods. See &quot;<a href="https://tsvibt.github.io/theory/pages/bl_25_11_12_01_33_54_942092.html">Is there one God or many?</a>&quot;.</p>
<p>But what is the difference, one might ask? What is the difference between &quot;merging&quot; many humans into one God, and merging many Gods into one True God?</p>
<p>The difference is that this &quot;merging&quot; is very thin and transactional. It's pure negotiation.</p>
<p>That's not the manner in which different humans merge with each other in theogenesis. We merge with each other by, for example, <a href="https://tsvibt.github.io/theory/pages/bl_25_11_12_01_24_25_062148.html">sharing algorithm-pieces with each other</a>. We change our values for each other. We refer to our values through each other. We value each other. We grow together.</p>
<p>God is the result of that process carried out in a never-permanently-distorted way.</p>
<p>So God is the closure under that procedure. That procedure stops before it gets to <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/HawFh7RvDM4RyoJ2d/three-worlds-collide-0-8">Baby Eaters</a>. The procedure does include care for other sentient beings, but that is a contingent fact about humans (which might be shared with some other beings, but certainly not all).</p>
