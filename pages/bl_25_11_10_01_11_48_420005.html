<p>As an analogy, can a government be understood? Of course yes, to a large extent. You can read documents, understand procedures and resources and rules and people and factions and history and so on. You can compare with other governments. In another sense though, you can't fully understand it. For one thing, it's really big and complex and incorporates many people, who are themselves complex. For another thing, if you understand it, then it suddenly becomes more complex because it can react to that understanding.</p>

<p>Some aspects of God can be understood by individuals. For example, you can understand various principles of law, justice, group epistemology, group agency; you can experience and understand various values; and you can understand various specific instances of God's operation. E.g. if you go outside and study a leaf deeply, you will understand the natural principles that give rise to it and its consequences; this is an exercise of God's understanding. E.g.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you can't understand all of God at once; there's no point in time where you've understood all of God. That's for two reasons: First of all, God is really big; God incorporates/partially-contains all humans including you, in some sense, and God is always growing, along with the [interfaces/aspects]-of-humans that compose God. Second of all, God is anti-inductive, diagonalizing, <a href="https://tsvibt.blogspot.com/2023/03/provisionality.html">essentially provisional</a>. Once you describe some aspect of God, it will immediately become the case that many humans are interested in this aspect--including in how it doesn't quite capture everything, how it's still a bit skew to the fullness of God; and they'll start investigating in those directions, creating and manifesting God's fullness in those out-of-ontology dimensions. (In other words, you convert <a href="https://tsvibt.blogspot.com/2023/01/endo-dia-para-and-ecto-systemic-novelty.html">ectosystemic novelty to diasystemic novelty to endosystemic novelty</a>, and thereby open up to novelty that was yet one step further out.)</p>
<p>This is analogous to (and a generalization of) how you can understand Science. You can deeply understand one small piece of Science (some field, some method). You can understand general methods (such as probability theory) that describe or are used in many regions of Science. But you can't understand all of Science: it is very big (many fields with a huge and growing body of knowledge), and it keeps getting richer (new epistemic methods, metascience, metalearning).</p>
<p>In other words, understanding (and constituting, creating, hearing, fighting, becoming, loving, being loved by) God is an <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/nkeYxjdrWBJvwbnTr/an-advent-of-thought#1_thinking_can_only_be_infinitesimally_understood_10_">infinite endeavor</a>.</p>
<p>More generally, God-the-ideal is always perfect, by definition [TODO link omnipotent], but God-the-already-manifested is never complete; theogenesis [TODO link] is never complete.</p>
