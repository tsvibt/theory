          <p>Treebeard, standing on a shelf of rock with two hobbits:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I'll call you Merry and Pippin, if you please – nice names. For I am not going to tell you my name, not yet at any rate." A queer half-knowing, half-humorous look came with a green flicker into his eyes. "For one thing it would take a long while: my name is growing all the time, and I've lived a very long, long time; so my name is like a story. Real names tell you the story of the things they belong to in my language, in the Old Entish as you might say. It is a lovely language, but it takes a very long time to say anything in it, because we do not say anything in it, unless it is worth taking a long time to say, and to listen to.</p>
<p>"But now," and the eyes became very bright and "present", seeming to grow smaller and almost sharp, "what is going on? What are you doing in it all? I can see and hear (and smell and feel) a great deal from this, from this, from this a-lalla-lalla-rumba-kamanda-lind-or-burúmë. Excuse me: that is a part of my name for it; I do not know what the word is in the outside languages: you know, the thing we are on, where I stand and look out on fine mornings, and think about the Sun, and the grass beyond the wood, and the horses, and the clouds, and the unfolding of the world."</p>

<p>Entish is a language spoken by the type of consciousness that always gives things their due weight--things which have been here for a long time, will be here for another long time, and which relate to many other things. Casual reference, a quick mention, is lost in the wind. It doesn't really refer ("carry back"). To really talk about something, to weild the full weight of considering it, takes more work. To freshly see the thing, to its core, the thing has to be weilded in this way--for inspection and application--not shoved around casually.</p>
<p>Entish is the home tongue for those <a href="https://tsvibt.github.io/theory/pages/bl_24_08_01_14_01_47_609192.html">dwelling</a> somewhere, and <a href="https://tsvibt.github.io/theory/pages/bl_24_08_02_09_12_51_000047.html">planting questions</a> there. Entish is appropriate for <a href="https://tsvibt.blogspot.com/2023/09/a-hermeneutic-net-for-agency.html">the hermeneutic net</a>: to work with a profoundly <a href="https://tsvibt.blogspot.com/2023/03/provisionality.html">provisional</a> concept, to even bring it up, has to involve an elaborate noun phrase that tells the past and future of the concept:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This concept---which has X as a central example and has Y as a barely-counterxample link, and which we use colloquially to mean this and that, and which we use technically to mean such or such, and which we would wish to use to better describe this or that phenomenon and to think more effectively in such or such context, and which may in some salient cases make proposition A true and proposition B false but in other salient cases make A false and B true, and which we used to think of in terms of ideas 123 but then we realized we'd better think of it in terms of 456---this concept is relevant to the current conversation in that...</p>
