Depends what you did. I don't know. Only God (which is to say, the ideal collectivity of humane souls](https://tsvibt.github.io/theory/pages/bl_25_11_10_01_10_51_803136.html)) knows.</p>
<p>My guess, which is only speculation, would be something like this: Insofar as what you are is [one who truly wishes true harm for humane souls], you will not be forgiven--you will be destroyed. Insofar as what you are is [one who truly wishes true thriving for humane souls], you will be forgiven for transgressions, after atonement (literally, becoming <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/atone">at-one</a>).</p>
