          <p>Since <a href="https://tsvibt.github.io/theory/pages/bl_24_08_22_06_10_53_253352.html">abstraction is a gain, not a loss</a>, moving to a space of possibilities described by combinable abstractions is not strictly a retreat to less structure. You're adding structure. </p>
<p>An ontic shift might require <a href="https://tsvibt.blogspot.com/2022/10/does-novel-understanding-imply-novel.html">new values</a>. <a href="https://tsvibt.blogspot.com/2022/11/do-humans-derive-values-from-fictitious.html#4-redescriptions">Coherentification</a> asks a question: what should my values be coherentified into? This is a question for a mind that doesn't yet have, laid out explicitly for zer, the space of possibilities over which the values would be "defined" / what the values would be "<a href="https://flowershow-hermeneutic-net.vercel.app/K/Hermeneutic%20Net/Referentiality,%20intentionality,%20etc">about</a>".</p>
<p>Also consider "<a href="https://flowershow-hermeneutic-net.vercel.app/K/Hermeneutic%20Net/Choiciness%20and%20defaults">choice</a>" and free will. </p>
