For example, God might be universal in that God thinks more in terms of Bayesian probability theory rather than frequentist probability theory, except in specific domains, and this would be true of God even if we had different values. Further, God is <a href="https://tsvibt.github.io/theory/pages/bl_25_11_10_01_37_41_628279.html">not already fully manifested</a>.</p>
<p>Thus, there is a process of theogenesis. This means manifesting God through your being, implementing God's self-constructing will, deciding what God is, listening to God, investing in God, figuring out what God is, and becoming more God-like or more able to participate in God.</p>
<p>Theogenesis is a large, long process. We're in the middle of it. The already-done parts include (some) religious practices and their meanings (prayers, rituals, festivals, restrictions); moral principles and rules that we've worked out; norms we've implemented; epistemology we've worked out; visions of the future we've expressed; voices from the past that we hear; etc.</p>
<p>Theogenesis is an <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/nkeYxjdrWBJvwbnTr/an-advent-of-thought#1_thinking_can_only_be_infinitesimally_understood_10_">infinite endeavor</a>. Compare &quot;<a href="https://tsvibt.github.io/theory/pages/bl_25_11_10_01_11_48_420005.html">Can God be understood?</a>&quot;. It's an open, <a href="https://tsvibt.blogspot.com/2023/03/provisionality.html">essentially provisional</a> process. The bush burns and is not consumed; <a href="https://berkeleygenomics.org/articles/Genomic_emancipation.html#the-bush">God will be as God will be</a>.</p>
<p>Theogenesis can be corrupted. Hitler short-circuited the theogenic forces of the Germans to coalesce political will much more strongly than the political will had been considered soulfully.</p>
