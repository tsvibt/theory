<p>No in the straightforward sense: For now, we are <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/sYgv4eYH82JEsTD34/beyond-the-reach-of-god">Beyond the Reach of God</a>. If your mother dies today, she dies for real, permanently, and is lost, probably even to God (unless she gets <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/w/cryonics">cryopreserved</a>). The dead can maybe be slightly redeemed, but almost certainly mostly not [TODO link].</p>
<p>Yes, in the sense that humanity's destiny is to be omnipotent as a collective, at least within the confines of what we can affect.</p>
<p>On the other hand, God may never be omnipotent. Theogenesis [TODO link] is partly a material process that can be interrupted. There's no <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deus_ex_machina"><em>apo mekhanes theos</em></a> that will prevent humanity from going extinct, or from falling into a distorted God [TODO link].</p>
<p>On the third hand, God is omnipotent in a sense--or rather, God <em>should</em> be omnipotent. The collectivity of humane souls <em>should</em> have power over the universe. So, to some extent we want to think of God as meaning &quot;God who is omnipotent&quot;. We don't need to be deluded or say false things, like &quot;God is omnipotent (already, materially)&quot;. But conceptually, it makes some sense to say things like &quot;God is by definition omnipotent&quot;, because in the sentence &quot;It is our duty to manifest God&quot; we mean &quot;God who is omnipotent&quot;; we would not be done yet if the God we had manifested was not omnipotent.</p>
<p>It matters that [God who is completed enough, though never fully complete] is omnipotent. For example, it matters that God enforces universal justice [TODO link justice]. You should not think that you will evade God. It matters that all that would be truly, unboundedly, uncorruptedly good is good through God / in God's world; you should not think of going against that world, and you should think of making that world rather than making something separate for yourself, and you should think of making the God who does include all that would be truly, unboundedly, uncorruptedly good.</p>
<p>That said, God is not a dictator [TODO link].</p>
