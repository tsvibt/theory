It is technically possible to avoid this. For example, because God is <a href="https://tsvibt.github.io/theory/pages/bl_25_11_10_01_37_41_628279.html">not currently omnipotent and omniscient</a>, you could strangle God in the cradle.</p>
<p>But, you shouldn't want to avoid that. <a href="https://tsvibt.github.io/theory/pages/bl_25_11_12_01_21_36_953212.html">God loves you</a>, and God is Just. So it's good for God to judge you. Though, this is only true if <a href="https://tsvibt.github.io/theory/pages/bl_25_11_12_01_25_36_704819.html">theogenesis</a> goes well.</p>
<p>Or to say it another way, you should care about the judgement of the True God, not the &quot;God-like entity&quot; that actually gets created, because that entity might be corrupted. Just like it kinda makes sense to say &quot;<a href="https://tsvibt.github.io/theory/pages/bl_25_11_10_01_37_41_628279.html">God is by definition omnipotent</a>&quot;, it also kinda makes sense to say &quot;God is by definition Just&quot;. You should respond to &quot;threats of punishment&quot; by God the Judge, because they aren't adversarial threats, but rather computations of what you (personally, and as part of the community of souls) will truly want upon much more growth and reflection together--computations that just happened to be especially accessible to you in your current position amidst the <a href="https://tsvibt.github.io/theory/pages/bl_25_11_12_01_25_36_704819.html">theogenic process</a>.</p>
<p>Setting up courts, carrying out trials fairly, court officers refusing bribes--of course these things should be done for the sake of us here today [TODO link For the sake of ] living with Just court systems. But in doing that, we also are engaging in theogenesis.</p>
